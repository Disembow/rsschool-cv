### ***About Me***

Dedicated, result-oriented, over 13 years in finance. An open-minded, adequate and honest person that likes learning and using new languages and tech stacks. Try and figure out how to improve the bad things and take the good things on board for any future ventures.

Iâ€™m always open to new approaches and look out for any tips and tricks I can apply to my own work.

As of now, I've started to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build UI for websites. My goal is to become Front-End Web Engineer and break into the software industry.
